# Machine Learning Models for Customer Churn and Supermarket Sales Prediction

This project aimed to explore various machine learning models for predicting customer churn and sales in a supermarket setting. The project involved two main tasks:

1. **Customer Churn Prediction**: Using machine learning models to predict customer churn based on demographic and transactional data.

2. **Supermarket Sales Prediction**: Building models to predict sales and customer behavior in a supermarket environment.

**Details of this experiments are in the Write_up pdf**
